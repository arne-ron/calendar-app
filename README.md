This is my current project for developing a tag-based calendar system.

The project is a full-stack web application using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and React in the Frontend and Backend, additionally utilizing a PostgreSQL database.

My system will be capable of fully implementing calendar standards and sourcing your calendars from other sources (like Apple or Google calendar) and also sharing calendars or events with other users.
